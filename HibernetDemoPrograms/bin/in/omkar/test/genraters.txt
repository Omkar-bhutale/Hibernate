This code snippet is from Java’s Hibernate framework. The @GenericGenerator annotation defines a strategy for generating values of primary keys. In this case, “gen1” is the name of the generator, and “increment” is the strategy, which means the value will be incremented by 1 each time a new entity is persisted. The @GeneratedValue annotation specifies that the generation of the primary key’s value should use the generator named “gen1”

	@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)//--> besst for mysql db
//	@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.SEQUENCE) -->best for oracle
	
	//if a sequance is created by devloper in oracle
//	@SequenceGenerator(name = "gen1",sequenceName = "JPA_SID_SEQUANCE",initialValue = 5,allocationSize = 5)
